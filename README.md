## Does the sentiment of news articles influence Amazon's stock price the next day?.

To test my hypothesis, I needed a sample to work with and determine my Pâ€”value. So I decided to use A/B testing with a significance level of 5%.
My objective was to compare the price before and after the article was released and if this followed the sentiment of the article's contents.

## Step by Step:


- Webscrapping: Using selenium to recollect 30 days of articles related to Amazon from the website Investing.com 
- NLP-Vader: Developing the criteria for determining if the article's wording was positive or negative. 
- Power BI Deployment: Showcase if I would be able to make any profit by only using fundamental analysis based on the news articles.
